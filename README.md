# Digital Health Sentiment Analysis

A project focusing on sentiment analysis in the digital health domain using BERT, a state-of-the-art natural language processing model.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze sentiments in patient reviews related to digital health services. The sentiment analysis model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a powerful deep learning model for natural language processing tasks.

## Key Features

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- BERT Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Save/Load Model
- Simple Interface for Predictions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DigitalHealthSentimentAnalysis.git
    cd DigitalHealthSentimentAnalysis
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Train the model (optional):

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

4. Run the sentiment analysis interface:

    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis_interface.py
    ```

## Model Customization

- You can fine-tune the model on your specific digital health dataset for better domain relevance.
- Explore different BERT variants and hyperparameters for optimization.
